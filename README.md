What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
1. Safety and security
2. Clarity
3. Approchability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

Why could the 5 Pillars be useful?
Safety and Security is not only usefull but very important because the more secure a Smart Contract is, the harder it can be hacked and the better the smart contract will do its job.
Clarity is useful on Cadence because its code is very easy to read, which will help attract more devlopers. And its also usefull because also people could understand more without beeing a dev.
Approachability and Developer Experience are useful because it will make cadence a great onboarding programming language for people to get into the Web3 space as developers.
